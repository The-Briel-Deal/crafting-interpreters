# Tokens with Infix and Prefix
Subtract is the only arithmetic operator like that in lox off the top of my
head. Another one in C would be the dereference and reference operators * and &
which have different meanings from the infix equivelant of when used as an
infix. As infix ops * means to multiply and & means to bitwise and.

`(` is actually another one in lox where its a prefix when grouping and an infix
when invoking a function.
