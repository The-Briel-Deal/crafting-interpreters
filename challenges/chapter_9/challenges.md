# Chal 1

We can implement control flow via types and interfaces. If we have multiple
types with the same interface that have the same method then we can execute one

# Chal 2

For loops you can use recursion in combination with dynamic dispatch, java,
rust, cpp and many other languages support this. We even use it here in the
interpreter.
