I would expect it to print 3 and then go back to one when the variable is out
of scope, I like local variable shadowing especially in new scopes, it allows
me to play with a variable in a certain context and then have it return to its
previous value at the end of the context. This is how things are in rust which
I like. That said, many other languages do disallow this.
