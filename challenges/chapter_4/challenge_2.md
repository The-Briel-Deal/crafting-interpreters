# What are some examples of edge cases where a space affects functionality.
In coffeescript and ruby, a space can cause things like lambda arguments to
behave different based on whether or not they are passed with a space or
without a space. C has a similar situation where a space is used to determine
if a macro is a simple macro or a function macro.
