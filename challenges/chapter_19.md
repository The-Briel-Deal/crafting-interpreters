# Chal 3

I think so long as there is a way to format strings containing numbers, then
its fine to make it so that + only works with the same types. I so rarely use
str + int in other languages, I would almost always prefer to use a format
string or printf function which gives you more granular control.

I also hate implicit conversions.
