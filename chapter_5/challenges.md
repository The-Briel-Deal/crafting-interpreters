## Challenges

1.  Earlier, I said that the `|`, `*`, and `+` forms we added to our grammar
    metasyntax were just syntactic sugar. Take this grammar:

    ```ebnf
    expr â†’ expr ( "(" ( expr ( "," expr )* )? ")" | "." IDENTIFIER )+
         | IDENTIFIER
         | NUMBER
    ```


    Produce a grammar that matches the same language but does not use any of
    that notational sugar.

    ```ebnf
    argument = expr "," argument;
    argument = expr;

    function_call = "(" argument ")"; 
    function_call =  "." IDENTIFIER; 

    expr = expr function_call;
    expr = expr "." IDENTIFIER; 
    expr = IDENTIFIER;
    expr = NUMBER;
    ```

    *Bonus:* What kind of expression does this bit of grammar encode?
    Calling a function

1.  The Visitor pattern lets you emulate the functional style in an
    object-oriented language. Devise a complementary pattern for a functional
    language. It should let you bundle all of the operations on one type
    together and let you define new types easily.

    (SML or Haskell would be ideal for this exercise, but Scheme or another Lisp
    works as well.)

    One idea that comes to mind is the C idiom where you just prefix the name
    of each method that is associated with the name of the type. For
    inheritance you could attach all of these functions as function pointers.

    Another option could be closures that contain the shared object.


1.  In [reverse Polish notation][rpn] (RPN), the operands to an arithmetic
    operator are both placed before the operator, so `1 + 2` becomes `1 2 +`.
    Evaluation proceeds from left to right. Numbers are pushed onto an implicit
    stack. An arithmetic operator pops the top two numbers, performs the
    operation, and pushes the result. Thus, this:

    ```lox
    (1 + 2) * (4 - 3)
    ```

    in RPN becomes:

    ```lox
    1 2 + 4 3 - *
    ```

    Define a visitor class for our syntax tree classes that takes an expression,
    converts it to RPN, and returns the resulting string.
