We can implement control flow via types and interfaces. If we have multiple
types with the same interface that have the same method then we can execute one
function with multiple implementations.

For loops you can use recursion in combination with dynamic dispatch, java,
rust, cpp and many other languages support this. We even use it here in the
interpreter.
